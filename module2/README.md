# üê≥ Docker Bootcamp ‚Äì Module 2: Installing Docker & Running Sample Containers

## Installing Docker
Docker can be installed on **Linux, Windows, or Mac**. It includes the **Docker Engine**, **Docker CLI**, and optional **Docker Desktop** tools.  
Installing Docker ensures that you can **build, run, and manage containers** locally on your system.

**Key Points:**
- Ensure your system meets Docker‚Äôs requirements  
- Choose the correct version for your OS  
- Understand the difference between **Docker Engine** and **Docker Desktop**  

---

## Running Sample Containers
Once Docker is installed, you can start running containers immediately.  
Some common examples:

- **Hello World:** Verifies Docker installation and container runtime  
- **Apache HTTP Server:** Run a simple web server  
- **Nginx:** Lightweight web server commonly used for containerized apps  

**Concepts Covered:**
- Understanding **container lifecycle**: create, start, stop, remove  
- Basic interaction with running containers  
- Difference between **image** and **container**

## Understanding Container Lifecycle Basics
A container goes through several stages during its lifecycle:

1. **Created:** Container is defined but not running  
2. **Running:** Container is active and executing processes  
3. **Paused / Stopped:** Container can be paused or stopped without removing  
4. **Removed:** Container is deleted from the system  

This lifecycle helps manage resources and maintain clean environments.
