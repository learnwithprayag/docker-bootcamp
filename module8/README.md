# üê≥ Docker Bootcamp ‚Äì Module 8: Docker Registry & Docker Hub

## Pushing and Pulling Images
Docker images can be **shared and stored** in registries for easy reuse:

- **Pull:** Download images from a registry to your local machine  
- **Push:** Upload your custom images to a registry  

This enables **collaboration** and **consistent deployments** across environments.

---

## Public vs Private Registries
- **Public Registry (e.g., Docker Hub):** Accessible to everyone, ideal for open-source projects  
- **Private Registry:** Restricted access, suitable for sensitive or proprietary applications  

Choosing the right registry ensures **security and accessibility**.

---

## Versioning and Image Tagging
- Tag images with **versions** to keep track of updates  
- Use semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`) to manage releases  
- Proper tagging helps with **rollback, deployment, and CI/CD pipelines**
