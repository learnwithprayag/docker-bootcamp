* Prints a confirmation message.

### Step 4: Check Running Containers

```bash
docker ps -a
```

* Lists all containers, including stopped ones.

### Step 5: Remove the Container

```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```

* Clean up the container after testing.

### Step 6 (Optional): Check Downloaded Images
