# üê≥ Docker Bootcamp ‚Äì Module 7: Docker Compose

## Introduction to Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool to **define and manage multi-container applications** using a single YAML file.  
It simplifies deployment and orchestration by allowing you to configure **services, networks, and volumes** in one place.

**Key Benefits:**
- Easy management of multi-container apps  
- Simplifies environment setup  
- Supports scaling and service dependencies  

---

## Writing `docker-compose.yml` for Multi-Container Apps
- Define each service (e.g., web, database, cache)  
- Specify container images, ports, volumes, and environment variables  
- Configure networks to enable communication between services  

This allows **consistent deployments** across environments and makes applications easier to manage.

---

## Scaling Services with Docker Compose
- Scale services up or down easily using `docker-compose up --scale`  
- Useful for **load testing** and handling **increased traffic**  
- Supports **service dependencies** to control startup order  

Compose is especially valuable for **microservices architectures** and **development workflows**.
