# üê≥ Docker Bootcamp ‚Äì Module 3: Docker Commands & Container Lifecycle

## Essential Docker CLI Commands
Docker provides a **command-line interface (CLI)** to interact with containers, images, networks, and volumes.  
Some key command categories:

- **Container Management:** `run`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `rm`  
- **Image Management:** `pull`, `build`, `tag`, `push`  
- **Inspecting Resources:** `ps`, `logs`, `inspect`  
- **System Management:** `system df`, `system prune`  

Understanding these commands is essential for **daily container operations**.

## Pausing, Restarting, Stopping, and Removing Containers
Containers can be managed dynamically:

- **Pause / Unpause:** Temporarily suspend container processes  
- **Restart:** Restart a stopped container without rebuilding  
- **Stop:** Gracefully stop a running container  
- **Remove:** Delete containers that are no longer needed  

This helps keep your environment **clean, organized, and efficient**.

## Inspecting Logs and Container Status
Monitoring containers is crucial to **debug and ensure proper execution**:

- **Logs:** View container output and errors  
- **Status:** Check whether containers are running, paused, or stopped  
- **Inspect:** Retrieve detailed metadata about containers and images  

These practices form the **foundation of container troubleshooting**.
