# üê≥ Docker Bootcamp ‚Äì Module 9: CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Automating Docker Builds and Deployments
GitHub Actions allows you to **automate workflows** such as building and deploying Docker containers:  

- Automate image builds whenever code changes  
- Deploy images to Docker Hub or production servers  
- Integrate tests and checks in the workflow  

Automation reduces **manual errors** and **speeds up delivery**.

---

## Integrating GitHub Actions with Docker Hub
- Configure GitHub Actions to **login to Docker Hub**  
- Push newly built images automatically  
- Ensure credentials are stored **securely using secrets**  

This enables a **continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** for containerized apps.
